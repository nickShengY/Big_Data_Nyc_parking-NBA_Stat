SmartParking NYC: Leveraging Big Data &amp; NBA Shot Analysis using Big Data

## SmartParking NYC: Leveraging Big Data & Predictive Modeling to Navigate NYC Parking

**Project Description**

This project utilized the power of Hadoop MapReduce to analyze a comprehensive dataset of more than 10 million parking tickets issued annually by the NYC Department of Finance. We aimed to gain insights into patterns of ticket issuance and determine the factors most influencing these incidents.

### Objectives

1. Analyze patterns in ticket issuance, including peak times and hotspot locations.
2. Identify most ticketed vehicle types and years.
3. Determine the vehicle color most likely to receive tickets.
4. Use K-Means clustering to provide practical insights and predictive modeling. (Bonus)

### Approach

Our analysis focused on two main parts:

- **Ticket Issuance Analysis**: We delved into various aspects of the ticket issuance data. Our goal was to unearth patterns related to the timing, location, and types of vehicles most prone to ticketing.
- **Color Susceptibility**: A distinctive part of our analysis revolved around determining which vehicle color is most likely to get ticketed.

We used the K-Means clustering algorithm to compute the rough probability of a black vehicle receiving a ticket when parked illegally at specific street codes. (Bonus)

To help individuals make informed parking decisions around the Lincoln Center, we subdivided the area into different zones using K-Means clustering.


## NBA Shot Analysis using Big Data and Machine Learning Techniques

**Project Description**

In this ground-breaking project, we delve into the exciting world of NBA by analyzing shot logs from the 2014-2015 season using the power of MapReduce and machine learning algorithms. We mined a large dataset detailing each shot to extract insights and develop new metrics.

### Objectives

1. Analyze shot logs in depth, including shooter details, shot location, nearest defender, shot clock time, and more.
2. Introduce and compute innovative metrics like 'fear score' and 'comfortable zone'.
3. Identify each player's 'most unwanted defender'.
4. Segment each player's performance into four unique 'comfort zones'.

### Approach

Our approach consisted of two main components:

- **Data Analysis**: Using MapReduce, we processed the extensive shot log data, focusing on the shooter, shot location, nearest defender, shot clock time, and more.
- **Metric Creation**: We introduced the novel metrics 'fear score' and 'comfortable zone'. The former quantifies a player's hit rate against their nearest defender, while the latter evaluates a player's shooting performance under different conditions in a 3-dimensional matrix.

The results provided deep insights into shooting strategies for NBA stars like James Harden, Chris Paul, Stephen Curry, and LeBron James.





## Applications

This project showcases our skills in Big Data analysis, predictive modeling, and problem-solving. It presents a practical application of quantitative analysis to a real-world urban issue and sports industry statistics.
